###### My current situtaion

xxxI completed the Level 3 Libraries, Information and Archive Services Assistant Apprenticeship with Kingston Heritage Service in March 2024. My motivation to undertake this apprenticeship was to persue a career working with archives and collections.

###### Why archives and collections

Although I have enjoyed museums from a very young age, I was wasn't aware of archives until I attended a National Archives Summer Series on maps just after completing A-levels back in 2018. Seeing the collection items close up on display after the tallks really sparked my interest, and the idea of working with archives and collections grew from that moment on.

Soon afterwards I started to volunteer at the Museum of Richmond, from where I progressed to volunteering at Richmond Local Studies Library and Archives and Kingston University Archives and Special Collections. My volunteering and efforts to find an apprenticeship were interrupted by Covid, but after re-opening I was able to start the LIAS apprenticeship part-time at Kingston History Centre.

###### Apprenticeship

My apprenticeship project was on the topic of building digital collections and digital preservation. With more and more born-digital and digitised material being produced, digital preservation is highly relevant to securing modern archive collections, and this is an area I am especially keen to further my skills in.

###### Volunteering

As my apprenticeship was part-time it took me three years to complete rather than the usual eighteen months, but this had the advantage that I was able to keep up my volunteering at Richmond and Kingston University, giving me additional experience in diffferent types of archives. Last year I started additional volunteering at the Royal Geographical Society.

###### Next steps

I am currently continuing with my volunteering as I explore next steps. As I do so, I am open to any further opportunities to grow my skills.

This blog site charts my ongoing learning and development as I seek a career working with archives and collections and provides a platform for sharing my portfolio.
